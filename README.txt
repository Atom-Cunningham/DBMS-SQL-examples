I put together this portfolio to demonstrate
some schoolwork I think is relevant to Salesforce.

Included is a group project, and a solo project
both using SQL and OracleDB to answer queries about
customer data.

I also included the assignements I could find
where I wrote SQL and some relational algebra
to solve prompts.

Because the front end of many Salesforce tools
use HTML/Similar markup languages, CSS,
and Javascript, I Included three websites I wrote.

You probably can't run these projects without a
great deal of setup, but they worked well when
I was running them on our university 
OracleDB server (DBMS)
and my MongoDB server (websites).
